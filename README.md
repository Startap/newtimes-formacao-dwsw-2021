# ðŸ¤– Simple Backend

Simple Backend it's a simple HTTP backend and mini-framework written in PHP. It's object-oriented into his classes, has a primitive route manager and serves webpages based on a dynamic generator using common header and footer and a content between them.

# ðŸ¤” Why another framework?

This is not a complete framework. We like [Laravel]([https://](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)) a lot. But after working and creating a lot of landing pages and mini websites we face the problem that our dependencies could be huge. So we started to develop a simple backend just to answer our HTTP requests. But then, more features was added: common header and footer, multiple views, controllers and environment variables.

There's still a plenty of work to do. But this backend it's a simple and perfect tool to begin all of our website today. We think it's simple (it can be simplier) and just fine to do what it live for: serve our webpages.

# ðŸ¤– Dependencies

Like a lot of project, we have some default and system dependencies. A price paid to have more flexibility in our project. 

```
    PHP @ ^7.3
    Composer
```

# ðŸš§ Features

We always have improvements to work on. There's NO ETA related to none of the tasks. All work it's tracked by our Issue Tracker and Discussions. All PR are welcome.

## ðŸ˜Ž Features that we think it should be cool to have

* Answer to POST requests
* Render 404 pages when route not found
* Better template engine to header and footer
* Reorganize folders, classes and controllers do make it right! ðŸ¤“
